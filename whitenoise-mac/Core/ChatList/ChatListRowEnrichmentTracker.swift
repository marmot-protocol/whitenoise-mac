/// Single-row chat-list updates spawn one enrichment `Task` per group. Exactly one such task
/// should "own" a group's slot at a time: a newer update must supersede (coalesce) an in-flight
/// one, listener teardown / account switch must cancel them all, and a finishing task must
/// release its slot only if it is still the current owner.
///
/// Ownership is keyed by a token that this tracker never reuses — not even after
/// `cancelAll()` clears the maps on reload / account switch. Monotonicity is per instance, not
/// global: two trackers each issue tokens from zero, which is harmless because a token is only
/// ever compared against the maps of the tracker that issued it. That is the crux of the fix: a
/// per-group counter that reset to its first value on clear would let a stale, already-canceled
/// task match a *future* task's reused token and erroneously drop the future task's slot,
/// reintroducing the untracked / uncancellable enrichment work this is meant to prevent.
